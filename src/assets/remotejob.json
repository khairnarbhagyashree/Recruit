We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money — all in one place. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people achieve financial progress. Come build with us!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div class=\"h1\"><strong>The role</strong></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As a member of the analytics team your mandate is to bring clarity to vast amounts of internal and external data so ONE can make better data driven business decisions, faster.  You’ll do so by building high-quality and scalable ground truth data sets and performing analysis that delivers actionable insights for the business. This role is focused on Customer Operations, spanning front and back office functions, automation capabilities, and agent staffing.

Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div class=\"h1\">Inclusion &amp; Belonging</div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.

A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/Insight/Tiger/etc.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $120/hr, you get $120/hr.

A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85MM+ since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;\">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $90-$150/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, Endeavor, Post News (the former CEO of Waze), the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;\">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals.

If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>\n<li style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;\">Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</span> for conversations hard to have elsewhere.
